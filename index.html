    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p> This is a series of three essays, based on my notes from a <a href="https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/12/">2017 PyData NYC tutorial</a>.  The first
    two essays are completely independent, and may be used as in introduction to <a href="Linear_Regression_slides.html">linear regression</a> or <a href="Probabilistic_Programming_slides.html">probabilistic programming</a>, respectively.  The third builds on the knowledge of those two,
    and uses the data set introduced in the first, but is fine to read if you are familiar with 
    linear regression and probabilistic programming.

    <p>The essays go along with Jupyter notebooks and exercises. You can install the requirements by following <a href="#Installation">instructions below.</a>  All material is <a href="https://github.com/ColCarroll/pydata_nyc2017">hosted on github</a>, and comments may be posted there as issues.

    <p>These talks cover a reasonable portion of three undergraduate courses in math, but requires only a hazy memory of the subjects to follow.  We derive linear regression, along with regularization, from the standpoint of
    <ul>
        <li>calculus, as the minimizer of a cost function,</li>
        <li>linear algebra, as a projection onto a subspace, and</li>
        <li>statistics, as the maximum a posteriori likelihood.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The goal of this talk is to help participants understand the math underlying so much of modern machine learning. I do not expect that attendees (or readers) will have new models or libraries to try, but I do expect that they will be better at tasks like diagnosing problems in the linear parts of their neural networks, explaining why logistic regression will be good (or bad) for a task, and giving colleagues some intuition for regularization.

    <h2 id="Installation">Installation</h2>

    <p>If you wish to follow along in the essays and exercises (which I would recommend), the easiest way to install the requirements is using conda, which is fastest to get via 
    <a href="https://conda.io/miniconda.html">Miniconda</a>. Should also work via pip and the supplied <a href="requirements.txt">requirements.txt</a> file.
    <ol>
        <li> Clone the repository from <a href="https://github.com/ColCarroll/pydata_nyc2017">https://github.com/ColCarroll/pydata_nyc2017</a>:
            <pre class="code">git clone https://github.com/ColCarroll/pydata_nyc2017.git</pre></li>
        <li> Navigate to the folder:
            <pre class="code">cd pydata_nyc2017</pre></li>
        <li> Create the conda environment:
            <pre class="code">conda env create -f environment.yml </pre></li>
        <li> Activate the environment with one of:
            <pre class="code">conda activate pydata_nyc20173.6  # new conda</pre>
            <pre class="code">source activate pydata_nyc20173.6  # OSX/Linux</pre>
            <pre class="code">activate pydata_nyc20173.6  # Windows</pre>
        </li>
        <li> Start the jupyter notebook server
            <pre class="code">jupyter notebook</pre></li>
    </ol>

    <p> There were a number of other talks and workshops at PyData NYC 2017 covering similar Bayesian 
    approaches. To mention a few talks, along with links to their videos (coming soon! placeholder for now):
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PyDataTV">Understanding NBA Foul Calls with Python</a> Austin Rochford</li>

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PyDataTV">Diamond: mixed-effects models in Python</a> Timothy Sweetser</li>

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PyDataTV">Bayesian inference in computational chemistry.</a> Chaya D. Stern</li>

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PyDataTV">Keynote</a> Andrew Gelman</li>
