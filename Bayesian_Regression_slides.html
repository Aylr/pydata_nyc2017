<p> This is part 3 of a three part workshop from PyData NYC in 2017. I converted my slides and notes to this essay, so I would have some artifact of the talk.  I hope you find the notes useful, and would love to hear from you about them!  That said, I likely will not change them, so that they remain a record of what was actually covered that fateful day in November.

                    <p>Our goal now is to model how the data is generated. But we know how the data was generated: we added some normally distributed noise to the data.
                    <p>We know that we are doing some serious work now, because these equations are joined by <em>two different</em> operators that are not "=", "&gt;", or "&lt;". The "&sim;" means that the items on the left and the right are probability distributions, rather than a single value. If we were being careful, distributions only make sense under an integral sign, but this is useful shorthand. 
                    <p>The "&prop;" means "proportional to". This means there is some quantity that I am claiming will not matter to the calculuation, but I encourage you to not trust me and do the bookkeeping of constants yourself.
                    <p>In this case, we are modelling the labels <b>y</b> as being normally distributed around <i>X</i><b>w</b>, for some <b>w</b>. The last equation on the slide is the normal distribution's probability density function.  Plugging in values for <b>x</b><sub><i>j</i></sub>, <i>y<sub>j</sub></i>, and <b>w</b> will let us evaluate the probability of any single point.

                  <p>Now these are some equations! Before diving in, we should step back and just admire this. Greek letters, underscores, no Python code at all. We will get to some working code soon, so Dr. Sargent does not think we are bullshitters, but for now we should just revel in this for a moment.

                  <p>Bringing this back into focus, the first two lines are from the previous page. They are our modelling assumption, and Bayes' rule. The third line is our assumption that the data is independent, so the probability of all the data is the product of the individual probabilities. 

                  <p> Finally, we take the negative log of the whole thing. This is nice from a numerical point of view: the product of a bunch of numbers less than 1 is going to be <em>very</em> small. So we turn that unstable product into a sum of numbers that are greater than 1. Also, the log is a monotone transformation: if we maximize the log of a function, we have also maximized the function. The negative sign lets us find a minimum instead of a maximum, which is a pleasant convention.

                  <p>Now all this holds for <em>any</em> probability distribution. Note that this sum comes from our likelihood, and the term on the right is called our prior. What happens when we plug in the normal distribution for our likelihood?

                  <p>The exponential and logarithm cancel each other out, and we are left with minimizing the sum of squares. That means the maximum a posteriori estimate will be exactly the set of weights that sklearn gives us! This is, of course, assuming that statistics, linear algebra, python, sklearn, and PyMC3 all work correctly.
                  <p>Also look at Pete. He thinks he is a detective!

                  <p> This is our linear model. We put an improper prior on the weights, so that any set of weights is equally likely. We fudge a little and put a prior on the standard deviation to avoid some problems in sampling a model with no noise. Finally, we define our likelihood in the last line. The function returns a PyMC3 model, which can be used as a context manager, so we can write some slick code.

It is helpful to remember that we are sampling from a joint probability distribution, so each set of weights comes with its own sampled standard deviation. We plot here are 100 sets of weights, along with *their* standard deviations. There is a line at 1 standard deviation, and another at 2 standard deviations. 
                    <p>We knew a lot about modelling this data, so the fit looks almost too good.  We will look at these plots again in a bad model later. For now observe that only one or two of the 100 points lies outside the second standard deviation line.

                    <p> Now the takeaway from this last bit of the talk is that when we are regularizing, we are just putting a prior on our weights. When this happens in sklearn, the prior is implicit: a penalty expressing an idea of what our best model looks like. When this happens in a Bayesian context like PyMC3, the prior is explicit, expresses our beliefs about the weights, and <em>can be</em> principled.

                  <p> Recall that for any model, the negative log likelihood will be in this form: a likelihood minus a prior. We haven't change the likelihood, so it is still the sum of squared errors, but now our prior is the sum of the squared weights. Notice that this is proportional to the cost function from ridge regression in sklearn, so the maximum a posteriori estimate for this model is exactly the ridge regression weights.

                    <p> Remember putting a prior that looked like <i>e<sup>-∑w<sub>j</sub><sup>2</sup></sup></i> on the weights gave us ridge regression. It is quick to show that putting a prior that looks like <i>e<sup>-∑|w<sub>j</sub>|</sup></i> gives us Lasso regression as a maximum a posteriori estimate. That particular distribution (once we normalize it) is the <em>Laplace disribution</em>, and it is built into PyMC3.

                    <p> I want to conclude with a warning that the Bayesian ridge and Bayesian Lasso we talked about here are not models you should actually use. These were presented to show that you could recover scikit-learn models from a Bayesian model, and that you were secretly making some assumptions when you used these models.   
                    <p>In practice, what is to be done? We live in a Bayesian world, and you should model your weights using prior information you have about them. If you wish to model sparsity in your weights, Aki Vehtari and Juho Piironen have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01694">a recent paper</a> proposing a better prior for a Bayesian treatment of sparse weights, and does a good job summarizing prior work on the topic. 
                    <p>It is a flexible world, and we should celebrate that.  Thank you for coming.
